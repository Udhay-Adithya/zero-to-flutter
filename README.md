# Flutter Learning Path üöÄ

Welcome to Zero to Flutter! This repository serves as a structured guide to help you master Flutter development from basics to advanced concepts.

## What is Flutter? ü§î

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices from a single codebase. 

### Why Choose Flutter? ‚ú®

- **Single Codebase**: Write once, deploy anywhere
- **Hot Reload**: See changes instantly during development
- **Rich Widget Library**: Beautiful built-in Material and Cupertino widgets
- **High Performance**: Native compilation and hardware acceleration
- **Strong Community**: Active developer community and extensive packages
- **Cross-Platform**: Deploy to iOS, Android, Web, Desktop from one codebase

### Flutter vs React Native: What to Choose? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- #### Choose Flutter When:
  - Performance is crucial
  - You need pixel-perfect designs across platforms
  - You're building a complex UI with custom animations
  - You want a single codebase for mobile, web, and desktop
  - Your team can invest time in learning Dart

- #### Choose React Native When:
  - You have a strong JavaScript team
  - You need extensive third-party integrations
  - Platform-specific look and feel is important
  - You're building an app that shares logic with a web version
  - Quick prototyping is prioritized over perfect UI consistency
